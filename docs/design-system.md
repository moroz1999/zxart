## Design System
The project follows a component-based approach for the design system. 

### Reusable Subcomponents
To maintain consistency and reduce code duplication, repeating UI patterns must be extracted into standalone Smarty templates (subcomponents).
- Never copy-paste logic for elements like controls, info blocks, or specific data displays across multiple components.
