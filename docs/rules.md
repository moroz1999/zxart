## Common rules:
- Keep it simple, don't invent unnecessary checks.
- All documentation and code comments must be in English.
- Documentation updates must be placed in the appropriate .md file (e.g., PHP rules in php.md, general rules in rules.md).
- Do NOT use magic numbers. Use class constants for single values or Enums for sets of related values.
- ALWAYS add newly created files to GIT immediately after creation.
- CSS/SCSS architecture:
    - Base variables (space, font-size, colors, radius, etc.) are for component variables ONLY.
    - Component variables must be defined in separate files (one per component).
    - Components (legacy and Angular) must use ONLY component variables, NO base variables directly.
    - See `styles.md` for detailed implementation rules.
