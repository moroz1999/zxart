## Common rules:
- Keep it simple, don't invent unnecessary checks.
- All documentation and code comments MUST be in English.
- After completing a task, re-read the task description and verify every point.
- After finishing the task code, it is necessary to read the rules on this topic from the .md docs once again and double-check your changes.
- Before starting a task, read only the parts of `domain.md` that are relevant to the task.
- Documentation updates must be placed in the appropriate .md file (e.g., PHP rules in php.md, general rules in rules.md).
- Any new knowledge about functionality must be added to separate sub-documents within `domain.md`.
- Documentation additions in `docs` must be concise, clear, and only about the core points.
- Do NOT use magic numbers. Use class constants for single values or Enums for sets of related values.
- ALWAYS add newly created files to GIT immediately after creation.
- When the IDE is in 'Ask' (readonly) mode, it is STRICTLY FORBIDDEN to do anything except answering the user's question. No file modifications or tool calls that change state are allowed.
