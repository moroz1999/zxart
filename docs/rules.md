## Common rules:
- Keep it simple, don't invent unnecessary checks.
- All documentation and code comments must be in English.
- Documentation updates must be placed in the appropriate .md file (e.g., PHP rules in php.md, general rules in rules.md).
- Do NOT use magic numbers. Use class constants for single values or Enums for sets of related values.
- ALWAYS add newly created files to GIT immediately after creation.
