## Common rules:
- Keep it simple, don't invent unnecessary checks.
- All documentation and code comments MUST be in English.
- After completing a task, re-read the task description and verify every point.
- Before starting a task, read only the parts of `domain.md` that are relevant to the task.
- Documentation updates must be placed in the appropriate .md file (e.g., PHP rules in php.md, general rules in rules.md).
- Any new knowledge about functionality must be added to separate sub-documents within `domain.md`.
- Documentation additions in `docs` must be concise, clear, and only about the core points.
- Do NOT use magic numbers. Use class constants for single values or Enums for sets of related values.
- ALWAYS add newly created files to GIT immediately after creation.
